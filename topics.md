# Topics

- pymarc patterns  (e.g. iterating over fields in a record instead of using the builtin `record.isbn` properties)
- pandas
- spacy
- pytest (parametrization)
- csvkit CLI
- notebooks
- type hints (3.5 but more & more features continue to be added like union types `dict|list` in 3.10)
- pydantic
- common patterns (list comprehensions instead of loops, creating a hashable dict?)
- powerful but underutilized components in the standard library (deduping with `set`)
- new features ([What's in Which Python](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/which-py.html) is a useful reference)
  - f-strings (3.6) are arguably the easiest way to format strings now
  - dataclasses (3.7)
  - `:=` walrus operator (3.8)
  - `match...case` ([3.10](https://peps.python.org/pep-0622/)) especially stuff like [real-world match case](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202312/realworld_matchcase.html) where it's used to introspect variable data structures (like JSON API responses that vary in structure)
- async code
- code editor configuration (linting, pylance)
- dependency management (virtualenv, pyenv, poetry, pipenv)
  - differnces between poetry and pipenv (poetry better for writing libraries, pipenv better for applications?)
