    "Note that the file is opened in read-binary mode (`rb`). Read mode is sufficient because we are not modifying the file. We use binary mode because Pymarc will handle decoding strings in records, we don't want Python to do it. Try deleting the `b` in `rb`—what happens? What would happen if we didn't have an `if record` condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several gotchas you can run into with encoding issues. The [`MARCReader`](https://pymarc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#pymarc.reader.MARCReader) class has a `to_unicode` parameter to return UTF-8 strings as well as a `force_utf8` parameter which coerces the data to UTF-8 (useful if you have records with inaccurate encodings). These parameters seemed to be more commonly needed under Python 2 where it was more work to manage string encodings.\n",
