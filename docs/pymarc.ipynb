What would happen if we didn't have an `if record` condition?\n",

The [`MARCReader`](https://pymarc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#pymarc.reader.MARCReader) class has a `to_unicode` parameter to return UTF-8 strings as well as a `force_utf8` parameter which coerces the data to UTF-8 (useful if you have records with inaccurate encodings).

There are also `record.series`, `record.subjects`, `record.physicaldescription` (all 300 fields), and `record.notes` (all 5XX fields) properties.
