    "We can see this still isn't great because adding a subtitle actually should change the `a` subfield (to end in a colon and not a forward slash `$aTitle : $bSubtitle /`). Basically, the point is that subfield lists are tricky and require a lot of forethought to get right with records of varying structure. If we know the structure of our records, we can be more confident in our manipulations. We can, of course, use some of the `get`-type methods to confirm our assumptions first, such as \"our 245 fields only have these subfields\", \"records only have one 856 field\", etc.\n",

    "Pymarc provides a number of ways of accessing record data, but the quickest, most convenient ways (convenience properties, bracket notation) tend to be the most error prone, especially when record structures vary or are unknown. We usually want to use methods that return lists of the fields and subfields we are interested in and iterate over these lists, which naturally works around absent data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that Pymarc let's us operate on fields/subfields either with its own specific object methods or by interacting with list properties on their parent objects. In general, the object methods are preferable and more targeted, but sometimes the lists are useful when we care about order (e.g. \"delete last field/subfield\")."
