    "# Type Hints\n",

    "Python Version: 3.5 but with many improvements added in the following releases.\n",

    "[Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "Python supports type hints which say what type of value a variable or function parameter is. They are not enforced by the Python interpreter but can be used by static type checkers like Mypy or Pylance in VS Code to catch errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use type hints?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints catch errors and make code more readable. For instance, a function signature like `def convert(date)` can be confusing on its own; is the `date` argument a string, a datetime object, or something else? Type hints concisely show us how a program expects to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hints are at their best catching unexpected return values from functions. For instance, we might have a hole in our logic that results in a function returning `None` (the value returned when we do not explicitly `return` anything) and then later consume that return value but not account for it being `None`. Another way they're immensely helpful is that type checkers _know the types and return values of everything in the standard library_ and most things in imported modules. They check that our understanding of others' code is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I started using type checking, one of the most common warnings I saw on our Django website was a lot of code which looks like `db.objects().last()` where I assumed I had an object but in fact this method can return `None` if no objects have been created in the database yet. Type hints know the expect return values of these `db` methods and catch such errors.\n"
