    "Pandas is a data analysis, manipulation, and visualization library. It's become a go-to tool for data scientists. Pandas not only provides many useful methods for working with data, but it's also quite fast because it vectorizes many operations, performing operations in parallel rather than one by one.\n",

    "There have been whole books written about Pandas and it's feature set is vast. Here, my goal is to demonstrate at a basic level _what Pandas can do_ in terms of loading, filtering, and visualizing data so you can determine if it's a tool you want to learn more about.\n"

    "A couple years ago, our video platform moved from an unlimited storage model to a tiered model with quotas for different types of hours of content. I had to analyze our current content to find a way to get under the quotas. That work is [on GitHub](https://github.com/cca/panopto-session-data) in [a notebook](https://github.com/cca/panopto-session-data/blob/main/notes.ipynb) that uses Pandas. Some of the facets of Pandas used include:\n",

    "- Creating filtered data frames based on conditions and time periods\n",

    "I didn't do any visualization because the raw figures were more useful, and it's hard to rerun the notebook with access to the specific reports I had, but it gives a sense of how to approach a problem with Pandas."
