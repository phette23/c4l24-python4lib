Pandas not only provides many useful methods for working with data, but it's also quite fast because it vectorizes many operations, performing operations in parallel rather than one by one.\n",

    "There have been whole books written about Pandas and it's feature set is vast. Here, my goal is to demonstrate at a basic level _what Pandas can do_ in terms of loading, filtering, and visualizing data so you can determine if it's a tool you want to learn more about.\n"
